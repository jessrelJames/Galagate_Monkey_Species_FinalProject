# 🐒 Galagate Monkey Species Identification System  
## A Flutter-Based Mobile Application with On-Device Machine Learning

---

## 📘 Abstract

The **Galagate Monkey Species Identification System** is a mobile application developed using **Flutter** and **TensorFlow Lite** that aims to identify different monkey species through image-based classification. The application utilizes an on-device machine learning model to process images locally, providing fast and reliable classification results without requiring internet connectivity. This project was developed as a **capstone requirement** to demonstrate the integration of mobile application development and machine learning technologies.

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. **Image Input**  
   The user provides an image containing a monkey.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   The image is resized and prepared for model inference.

3. **Classification**  
   The TensorFlow Lite MobileNet-based model analyzes the image and produces probability scores.

4. **Result Presentation**  
   The species with the highest confidence score is displayed to the user.
